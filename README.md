## Arduino

Basically the file names are self explanatory. Still if you don't know what does what, study and comme back.

## ESP8266

Some basic files. Nothing special, just dumped stuff from my hdd folder

## Serial Monitors

Serial monitor scripts in C/C++, Pyython, JS and I shall add more as I learn more (■ ͟ʖ■)━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ

## Usb Authorization

Using these scripts you can take over the world! JK! Its a bit complex to explain those scripts, if you are worthy, you shall find out (｡◕‿◕｡)

The name is enough, I guess? It has some basic protocol and SysInit scripts.
